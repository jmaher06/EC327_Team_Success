Only Necessary files to run the game are Board.h, Board.cpp Piece.h, Piece.cpp, makefile
Currently doing testing in testing.cpp

To test commands on testing.cpp, type make which creates an executable called test

Couldn't get IsPieceBetween member of board class to work, so currently all pieces can jump over eachother.
